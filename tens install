Please inspect your PYTHONPATH as it looks wrong. You should give absolute paths to the caffe module's parent directory. For instance, in my configuration I did:
# in caffe root dir
make all
make pycaffe
make distribute
# make dir for custom python modules, install caffe
mkdir ~/python
mv distribute/python/caffe ~/python
# set PYTHONPATH (this should go in your .bashrc or whatever
PYTHONPATH=${HOME}/python:$PYTHONPATH
